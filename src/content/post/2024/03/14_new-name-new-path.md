IMPORTANT, PLEASE READ:
New name, new path. As some might know already, there’s been a lot of renovating and redesigning in the ol’ basement. After all these huge changes and new energies in the shop we decided to rename the dungeon. It is now called Graven which means “The Grave” in Danish. The shop is based on heavy metal and all the dark obscurities the heavy metal environment is known for. Wicked Workshop will continue as a brand and with Thomas at the steering wheel and all conventions are still on, which we also will have more information about tomorrow! (Monday)
Big love ❤️
David, David, Thomas and Rasmus.
