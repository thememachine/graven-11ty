Electric Sun Tattoo Music Festival 2024

ELECTRIC SUN is a colorful tattoo and musical experience at Onkel Dannys Plads, Vesterbro.

Tattoo artists will be ready to pimp your body with old-school, cartoon, new-school – all things colorful.

2 days of live music, 20 great tattoo artists, vendors, and loads of beers! Get some new ink and enjoy a cold beer in the sun, while you rock out to some great bands.

Over the next week, we will release the full band list, vendors, and tattoo artists – so spread the word – and remember it’s FREE ENTRANCE for both days.
